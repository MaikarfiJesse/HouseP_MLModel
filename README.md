# HouseP Prediction API
This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various input features. The model is trained using Linear Regression on house price data and is deployed as a web application using Flask. This setup provides a practical example of how to transition a model from Python code to a live web API.

# Requirements 
This project is developed using Python 3.8.0 and Flask 2.0.1. All dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.
